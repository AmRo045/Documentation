# üóùÔ∏è Animations

There are two types of animations in Avalonia:

* [Keyframe animations](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/animations/keyframe-animations) animate any number of properties on a control, using any number of keyframes to define the states that each property must pass through. Keyframe animations are the more versatile type of animation.
* [Transitions](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/animations/transitions) are used to animate a single property change.
